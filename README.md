# fire_alarm_using_gsm800
a quick alarm system who calls who when it detects the fire .

# purpose for this project

its sad that we dont have solving technology to solev the fire break down completely in the tech and other industries .
but we *engineers* do found a one of the way to prevent the fire breakdown 

**introducing the alarm system**  by gsm 800 module 

# working principle

when ever the arduino or esp module detects the fire using the gas or flame sensor , the gsm 800/900 module will be activated , using the arduino documentation we can even choose whom to alert , the gsm module just calls the main user so that he /she can do something on that
